Welcome to SonicAlchemist!

To start making sounds click any of the buttons in the central frame to activate them, then press the play button located in the toolbar. During playback you can also activate or deactivate sounds, without having to restart the audio.

To add a sonic ambiance, click on any of the four circular buttons representing fire, water, earth and air. 

To stop the audio, click the stop button located in the toolbar. 

If you would like to export your audio, we recommend that you download Audio Hijack Pro [http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/] (Mac only), a free application that allows you to record audio from your browser. We are currently not aware of a free alternative for Windows users, but suggest Total Recorder [http://www.highcriteria.com] as the best alternative.



If you would like to contribute to the constantly-changing sound bank, Tweet us a link to your sample @sonicalchemist1. We recommend hosting your sample on SoundCloud, which can produce a download link for you. We will then upload your sample to the SonicAlchemist SoundCloud account (SonicAlchemistUK) in order to be used with the site.
